Description: A toolbox of simpler alternatives and wrapper functions to R
    features. The intent is threefold: simplify features whenever possible
    (keep it simple), minimize reliance on dependencies (keep it small),
    and provide pure R alternatives that are as fast and efficient as
    possible (keep it fast).
